# Introduction

> A powerful, modern version bumping tool with comprehensive Git integration and monorepo support.

## What is bumpx?

bumpx is a version management tool that simplifies the process of bumping versions across your projects. It focuses on:

- **Semantic versioning** with full semver compliance
- **Git workflow automation** with commits, tags, and pushing
- **Multi-file version management** across different file types
- **Monorepo support** with flexible versioning strategies
- **Cross-platform compatibility** on macOS, Linux, and Windows

Whether you're managing a single package or a complex monorepo, bumpx provides the tools you need to automate your release process with confidence and consistency.

## Key Features

- üî¢ **Semantic Versioning** ‚Äî Full support for patch, minor, major, and prerelease versions
- üîÑ **Git Integration** ‚Äî Automated commits, tags, signing, and push operations
- üì¶ **Multi-File Support** ‚Äî Update versions across package.json, VERSION files, and source code
- üèóÔ∏è **Monorepo Ready** ‚Äî Independent or synchronized versioning for multiple packages
- üåê **Cross-Platform** ‚Äî Consistent behavior on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- üöÄ **CI/CD Integration** ‚Äî Built-in support for GitHub Actions and other CI platforms
- üéØ **Interactive Mode** ‚Äî Guided version selection with commit history context
- üîç **Dry Run Mode** ‚Äî Preview changes before applying them
- ‚ö° **Fast & Reliable** ‚Äî Efficient file processing with comprehensive error handling

## How It Works

bumpx automates your entire version bumping workflow:

1. **Detects current versions** across your project files
2. **Calculates new versions** based on semantic versioning rules
3. **Updates all relevant files** with intelligent pattern matching
4. **Creates Git commits and tags** with customizable messages
5. **Pushes changes** to your remote repository
6. **Runs post-bump scripts** for builds, tests, or deployments

All of this happens in a single command, with full transparency and control over each step.

## Quick Example

Here's how simple version bumping becomes with bumpx:

```bash
# Install bumpx
npm install -g @stacksjs/bumpx
# or
bun add -g @stacksjs/bumpx

# Basic version bump (recursive workspace detection by default)
bumpx patch
# 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1, automatically finds and updates all workspace packages

# Version bump with Git workflow (all enabled by default)
bumpx minor
# 1.0.1 ‚Üí 1.1.0, creates commit, tag, and pushes to remote

# Interactive version selection
bumpx prompt --print-commits
# Shows recent commits and version options

# Monorepo version management with automatic workspace detection
bumpx patch
# Updates all workspace packages in your monorepo automatically

# Custom files and post-bump actions
bumpx major --files "package.json,VERSION.txt,src/version.ts" \
           --execute "bun run build && bun test"

# Prerelease versions
bumpx prerelease --preid beta
# 1.1.0 ‚Üí 1.1.1-beta.0, with automatic git operations

# Dry run to preview changes
bumpx minor --dry-run --verbose
# Shows what would be changed without making changes

# Changelog generation (enabled by default)
bumpx patch
# Automatically generates changelog from git commits
```

## Configuration

Configure bumpx to match your workflow:

```typescript
// bumpx.config.ts
export default {
  commit: true,
  tag: true,
  push: false,
  message: 'chore: release v%s',
  tagMessage: 'Release v%s',
  execute: 'bun run build && bun test'
}
```

Or in package.json:

```json
{
  "bumpx": {
    "commit": true,
    "tag": true,
    "message": "chore: release v%s"
  }
}
```

## Why Choose bumpx?

bumpx offers significant advantages over manual version management and other tools:

- **Comprehensive**: Handles files, Git operations, and post-bump actions
- **Reliable**: Extensive validation and error handling prevent mistakes
- **Flexible**: Works with any project structure or workflow
- **Fast**: Efficient processing even for large monorepos
- **Modern**: Built with TypeScript and modern Node.js features
- **Well-documented**: Extensive guides and examples

## Real-World Scenarios

### Single Package Release

```bash
# Git operations (commit, tag, push) enabled by default
bumpx patch
```

### Feature Release with Testing

```bash
# Automatic git workflow with post-bump testing
bumpx minor --execute "bun run build && bun test"
```

### Monorepo Synchronized Release

```bash
# Automatic workspace detection with synchronized versioning
bumpx major --current-version 1.0.0
```

### CI/CD Automation

```bash
# Non-interactive CI mode
bumpx patch --ci --execute "bun run deploy"
```
