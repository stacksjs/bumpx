# Postcardware

bumpx is postcardware, meaning it's free to use but we'd love to receive a postcard from you if you find it useful.

## About Postcardware

Postcardware is a type of freeware where authors request users send a postcard from their location if they find the software helpful. It's a simple way to see where the software is being used around the world.

## Send Us a Postcard

We enjoy receiving postcards from bumpx users. It helps us see where our tool is being used and connects us with the developer community.
